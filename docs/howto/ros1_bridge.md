# ros1_bridge: bridging Autoware.Auto (ROS 2) and Autoware.AI (ROS 1) applications {#ros1-bridge}

The [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) application provides a network bridge
to enable the exchange of messages between ROS 1 and ROS 2, allowing ROS 1 tools like
`rviz`, `rqt_plot`, `image_view`, and `rosbag` to work with ROS 2 applications.

This article explains how to build the `ros1_bridge` within ADE, and validate the connection between
Autoware.Auto and Autoware.AI using a `pcap` file, the
[velodyne_node](https://gitlab.com/AutowareAuto/AutowareAuto/tree/master/src/drivers/velodyne_node),
the `ros1_bridge`, and `rviz`.


## Requirements

The `ros1_bridge` is limited to the message/service types that are available at compile time of the
bridge; therefore, the `ros1_bridge` must be compiled from source. The `ros1_bridge` **must be built
when a new message type is defined**.

The instructions below assume that ROS 2 Bouncy has been installed (already available in `ade`), as
well as [ROS 1 Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).

If custom messages have been defined in the `~/workspace`, build and source the workspace containing
the message definitions before starting (see `ade$ source ~/workspace/install/setup.bash` below).


## 1. Build the ros1_bridge {#build-ros1-bridge}

For more details, see the
[ROS 2 wiki instructions](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge#building-the-bridge-from-source).

Follow the steps below to clone and compile the `ros1_bridge`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ source ~/workspace/install/setup.bash  # Only if you have custom messages
ade$ mkdir -p ~/ros1_bridge_ws/src
ade$ cd ~/ros1_bridge_ws/src
ade$ git clone https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge.git --branch 0.5.0
ade$ cd ..
ade$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
ade$ colcon build --merge-install --packages-select ros1_bridge
```

\note
After sourcing ROS 1 Melodic, the following warning will appear; it can safely be ignored while
following this workflow:
```
ade$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
ROS_DISTRO was set to 'bouncy' before. Please make sure that the environment does not mix paths from
different distributions.
```

To enable the `ros1_bridge` by default (for all future terminals), source the install directory in
the `~/.bashrc` file. It's also **strongly recommended** to add the following alias so that the
`ros1_bridge` and `roscore` can be started with a single command.

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ echo "source ~/ros1_bridge_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
ade$ echo 'alias start_ros1_bridge="( source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash && ( roscore & source ~/ros1_bridge_ws/install/setup.bash && sleep 1 && ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge --bridge-all-topics ) && killall roscore ) || killall roscore"' >> ~/.bashrc
ade$ source ~/.bashrc  # To enable it for the current terminal
```


## 2. Test the ros1_bridge {#test-ros1-bridge}

To perform a simple test of the `ros1_bridge`, open three terminals:

ADE Terminal 1 - start `roscore` and `ros1_bridge`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ start_ros1_bridge
```

ADE Terminal 2 - publish a message with ROS 2:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ ros2 topic pub /test std_msgs/Bool -r 1
```

ADE Terminal 3 - listen for the message on ROS 1:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
ade$ rostopic echo /test
data: False
---
data: False
---
...
```

If the output in the terminal matches what is shown above, congratulations! The `ros1_bridge` is
compiled and installed properly.

Enter `Ctrl-C` to stop the applications.


## 3. Run Autoware.Auto and Autoware.AI applications {#autoware-auto-autoware-ai}

This section leverages the [velodyne_node](https://gitlab.com/AutowareAuto/AutowareAuto/tree/master/src/drivers/velodyne_node),
which accepts UDP data as an input. Download the sample pcap file containing two LiDAR point clouds
generated by the Velodyne VLP-16 Hi-Res:

- [Dual VLP-16 Hi-Res pcap file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vNA009j-tsVVqSeYRCKh_G_tkJQrHvP-)

Place the pcap file within the `adehome` directory, for example `ade-home/data/`.

ADE Terminal 1 - start `roscore` and `ros1_bridge`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ start_ros1_bridge
```

ADE Terminal 2 - start `rviz`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
ade$ rviz
```

ADE Terminal 3 - start `udpreplay`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ udpreplay ~/data/route_small_loop_rw-127.0.0.1.pcap
```

ADE Terminal 4 - start the `velodyne_node`:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ ros2 run velodyne_node velodyne_cloud_node_exe --config_file /home/"${USER}"/AutowareAuto/src/drivers/velodyne_node/param/vlp16_test.param.yaml
```

\note
The steps above leverage a pcap file, however the `velodyne_node` can be connected directly to
the sensor. Update the IP address and port arguments in the yaml file to connect to live hardware.

When the `velodyne_node` is running resulting LiDAR point cloud can be visualized within `rviz` as
a `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` topic type. The data will look similar to the following image:

![Autoware.Auto velodyne_node point cloud snapshot](autoware-auto-velodyne-node-point-cloud-snapshot.png)

The ROS 1 `rostopic` tool can also be used to validate the
flow of sensor data from the pcap file, through the `velodyne_node`, and through the `ros1_bridge`
to the ROS 1 domain:

```bash
$ ade enter
ade$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
ade$ rostopic echo /test_velodyne_node_cloud_front
```
